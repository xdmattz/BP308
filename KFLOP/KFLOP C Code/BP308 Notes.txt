BP308 Notes

These are notes on the KFLOP code for the Bridgeport Discovery 308 VMC

Trying to figure out the operations of the machine and how to break the tasks up
There are at least XXX levels of software on the BP308. 

KFLOP Servo code and Thread 0
        |
        |
    KFLOP Thread 1 code forever loop
        |
        +----- > TLAUX Tool changer -- PSoC5
        |
        +----- > MPG Manual Pulse Generator -- PSoC5
        |
        |
    KFLOP Thread 2 code - run once operations, like M-Codes
        |
        |
    KFLOP Thread 3 code - another run one operation that may need to run simultaneously with Thread 2. Threading routine?
        |
        |
KMotion - for Testing
KMotionCNC for CNC or MACH3 for G-code reading and motion control commands


KFLOP Thread 1 code
(main file is BP308_Startup.c)

Initializes the hardware

main loop that runs forever. 
Always checks for ESTOP
Manages the Serial Port - looks for a valid received message
